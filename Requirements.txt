Installation Guide

Step 1: Make sure Python is installed
Check Python version by running:
python --version

Step 2: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv env

Activate it:
- Windows:
env\Scripts\activate
- Linux / Mac:
source env/bin/activate

Step 3: Install required Python libraries
Your requirements.txt file should look like this:
pandas
matplotlib
yfinance

Then run this command in your terminal:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Verify installation
Run this small Python code to make sure everything works:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import yfinance as yf

print("All libraries are installed successfully!")

After this, your environment is ready to run the Tesla stock analysis project.
